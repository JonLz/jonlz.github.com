  <div class="entry-content"><p>October ended up being a great month for my programming career. I feel a lot better versed in ruby syntax and started becoming a lot more confident in rails. I&#8217;m able to think up solutions to problems in much more programmatical/organized manner and am slowly beginning to understand how the basic rails information flow works. I still don&#8217;t quite understand routing as I&#8217;m still creating routes by hand and not using the built in rails paths. Maybe I need to read up on REST, but I&#8217;m definitely going to be focusing on this next month.</p>

<p>My git workflow is getting a lot more effortless as well. I need to begin working on some open source projects to learn collaboration skills on projects but my use of git-fu for source control is strong now. I&#8217;ll be creating a page for my most used git commands and any cool ones I discover, I&#8217;m still looking up new ones almost daily or trying to refine my workflow.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also slowly starting to become more competent in javascript, jquery, and css which is definitely showing up as I work through rails views. Next up is understanding json and how to have rails serve up friendly javascript variables to my views. I&#8217;m sure theres millions of helpers/gems available out there - it&#8217;ll be time to find them and report back here when I do. I don&#8217;t think my projects are big enough to get going with backbone and node yet (or would even need node for the architectures I&#8217;m using) but it&#8217;s good to have some working knowledge of them as I pursue full-stack programming.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I finally got tired of my windows IDE and I&#8217;m working on setting up a new Mac, monitor, and programming environment. Time to learn all the bash commands I&#8217;ve been missing out on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I sat down last night and started getting back into Rails finally.  I feel like I&#8217;m at a point with ruby now where I&#8217;m pretty comfortable with basic syntax and program flow.  I probably spent a little more time than I would have liked to getting up to speed with ruby since my main aim is to build web apps but damn if ruby programming isn&#8217;t just <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p>As part of my rails project I made sure to set it up so I could do it in a TDD way.  I kept hearing great things about Guard (a ruby gem) on the rogues podcast and a couple of other places (the rails tutorial by Michael Hartl also talks about it) so I gave it a try.  Long story short, this thing is amazing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Conway&#8217;s Game of Life</h2>

<p>If you aren&#8217;t familiar with Conway&#8217;s Game of Life, it&#8217;s a set of rules that simulates cellular evolution based on the initial state of a group of cells.  The game consists of a simple ruleset that algorithmically determines a cell&#8217;s state based on its surroundings.  It&#8217;s simple in practice but some of the resulting evolutions are fascinating.  It&#8217;s also a great advanced beginner programming challenge!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>September was a whirlwind of a month of balancing my newfound obsession with ruby and other things in life.  I managed to learn a LOT and hopefully not shirk too much of my real life (apologies if I did to friends and loved ones).  I got through an entire book on ruby, finished the rails tutorial, started listening to a ruby programming podcast, and found an awesome new ruby training resource.</p>

<p>I learned what technical debt was (in a nutshell, payoffs now for the tradeoff of necessary refactoring and upgrading code later) and wow does this apply to new programmers who are basically crushed by a mountain of technical debt. The only thing you can do is take it a day at a time and a project at a time.  Always be coding. Constantly improve your skills!</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also so much to love about the ruby community I don&#8217;t even know where to start.  The amount of knowledge I was able to gather for free is astounding.  I think the only thing I&#8217;ve paid for up until this point is The Well Grounded Rubyist book and it feels like I&#8217;ve come a long way in just one month.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I&#8217;m about 2 months behind now on starting this blog but better late than never, right? I began my foray about 2 months ago and discovered the Ruby language and more importantly, the fantastic Ruby community.  I sort of stumbled into ruby because I really wanted to learn a web framework and found out about ruby on rails.  I had no idea what ruby was and thought the code in rails was pretty wickedly awesome - then I discovered it was just built on top of ruby, mindblowing.  Since then, I took a step back and dived pretty deep into ruby in order to become proficient in it.  I&#8217;m at an okay point with it now and will be venturing back into rails which should hopefully be a little easier now.  I still &lt;3 ruby though.</p>
